So this is a little experiment in trying to write a "secure" chat client/server.

And it actually ended up working.  I know I cant believe it either...

I borrowed most of the code and just made a few changes myself.
So here are a few links to those sites.

https://docs.python.org/2/library/hashlib.html 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12524994/encrypt-decrypt-using-pycrypto-aes-256

Anyway DO NOT USE THIS IN PRODUCTION.  Its probably broken in some horrible way.

The license (for my code at least) is use it how ever you want.

And remember to have fun. :)
